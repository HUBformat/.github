## Overview

**FPHUB-RISCV** is an open-source project developing a Floating-Point Unit (FPU) for the **RISC-V** architecture, designed for low-power and resource-constrained applications. This unit is based on the **FPHUB format**, an alternative to IEEE 754 that simplifies hardware complexity while maintaining computational precision.

The **FPHUB format** is a novel floating-point representation that reduces hardware complexity and power consumption while preserving numerical precision. It achieves this by modifying the significand structure, eliminating subnormal numbers, and supporting only rounding-to-nearest, making it an efficient alternative for embedded and low-power computing environments.

## Licensing & Patents

This project is open-source, but certain aspects of the **FPHUB format** are covered by **Spanish patents** held by the **Universidad de Málaga**. Commercial use within Spain may require a **technology transfer agreement**.

## Acknowledgments

This project is funded by the **Spanish Government** under **Next Generation EU** and supported by the Universidad de Málaga.
